## 🏗️ Layered Architecture  

BlockMeet is structured into a clean, modular architecture:  

### 📂 `apps/`  
1. **Client**  
   - Contains the front-end application built with **React**.  
   - Handles the user interface for video conferencing and file storage.  

2. **Server**  
   - The half-brains of the operation, powered by **Node.js** and **Express**.  
   - Manages:  
     - Meeting creation  
     - Adding participants  
     - Handling sign-ups and sign-ins  

3. **WebSocketServer**
   - The other half-Brain
   - This is where the Hydrocarbon stucture is formed 
   - The real-time communication hub for **WebRTC** signaling.  
   - Facilitates the exchange of ISP data and ensures seamless peer-to-peer connections.  

4. **Logging**  
   - Home to **Solidity smart contracts** built with the **HardHat👷🏽**.  
   - Logs meeting events immutably on the **Polygon blockchain**.

## 🌟 How BlockMeet Works  

### 1️⃣ Setting Up a Meeting  
- Define participants before creating a meet.  
- The app calculates **super peers** using the formula:  
  `super_peer_count = ceil(participant_count / 3)`  

### 2️⃣ Joining the Meeting  
- Participants connect in the following order:  
  - The first participant becomes the **first super peer**.  
  - The second participant becomes the **second super peer**.  
  - Subsequent participants connect alternately to super peers in a round-robin manner.  

### 3️⃣ Data Transfer  
- **Super peers** act as relay nodes, transferring video/audio streams between participants.  
- This ensures efficient communication and keeps the architecture simple yet effective.  

### Why This Design?  
- Targeted for **small, private meetings**.  
- Optimized for confidentiality, security, and minimal lag.  
- Perfect for discussions where sensitive information is shared.
